# NLP-for-Mental-Health-MIT-URTC-2024-

This project presents a novel approach to detecting and classifying mental health abnormalities using advanced deep learning architectures. We leverage a combination of BERT for contextual embeddings, LSTM for sequential data handling, GNN for capturing social interactions, and Roberta with temporal attention for advanced sequential modeling. Our model aims to improve upon existing methods by integrating multiple modalities and considering both linguistic nuances and social context. The project includes data preprocessing scripts, model implementation, training and evaluation code, and benchmarks against established models to demonstrate significant performance improvements. This work aims to contribute to the field of mental health detection using social media data, providing a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to identifying various mental health conditions.
