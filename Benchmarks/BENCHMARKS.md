## Benchmarks

The first benchmark this project uses is a CNN - LSTM algorithm originally developed by Asv53. The code was adapted from [Depression-Detection-using-a-Hybrid-CNN-LSTM-Layer] (https://github.com/Asv53/Depression-Detection-using-a-Hybrid-CNN-LSTM-Layer).

The second benchmark this project uses are the results from a Logistic Regression with TF-IDF model from a study conducted by Ilija Tavchioski, Marko Robnik-Sikonja, and Senja Pollak on the detection of depression on social networks using transformers and ensembles. The algorthims developed in this study are not publically available, however their results are shown in Log Reg with TF-IDF.png.  You can read their study in greater detail at https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05325
