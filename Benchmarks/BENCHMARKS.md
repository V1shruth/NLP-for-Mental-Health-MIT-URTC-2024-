## Benchmarks

This project uses CNN - LSTM benchmarking code originally developed by Asv53. The code was adapted from [Depression-Detection-using-a-Hybrid-CNN-LSTM-Layer] (https://github.com/Asv53/Depression-Detection-using-a-Hybrid-CNN-LSTM-Layer).

This project uses results of a Logistic Regresstion with TF-IDF model from a study conducted by Ilija Tavchioski, Marko Robnik-Sikonja, and Senja Pollak on Detection of depression on social networks using transformers and ensembles. 

Their results are shown in Log Reg with TF-IDF.png

You can read their study in great detail at https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05325
